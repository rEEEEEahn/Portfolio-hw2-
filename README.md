## Description
For homework 2, I was tasked to create a Portfolio for my web development achievements. For this assignment, I had to build the code from the ground up. Honestly, It was quite tough for me. HTML portion was not too bad, but the CSS portion was a tough one to climb. I forgot that John (instructor) told us that it would be easier to code from a mobile platform first. I did Desktop, then flip-floped between things; it was a mess. Lesson learned to really take it slow and work one part at a time. I did most of the required tasks, and hope to do even better next time with more practice.

## Installation
Started with HTML then went on to css. The plan was to build the css one part at a time, but I got distracted and bounced around which made the assignment a lot harder. Last part was to add the read me.
## Usage
   ```md
[HTML and CSS](./assets/images/htmlcss.png)
    ```

    ```md
[deploy to git hub](./assets/images/github.png)
    ```
    Last step is to turn in 2 links: 1. Github pages link; 2. github link for code!
## Credits
Thank you John for some jumping off points regarding css!
