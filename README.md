## Description
For homework 2, I was tasked to create a Portfolio for my web development achievements. For this assignment, I had to build the code from the ground up. Honestly, It was quite tough for me. HTML portion was not too bad, but the CSS portion was a tough one to climb. I forgot that John (instructor) told us that it would be easier to code from a mobile platform first. I did Desktop, then flip-floped between things; it was a mess. Lesson learned to really take it slow and work one part at a time. I did most of the required tasks, and hope to do even better next time with more practice.

## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
Thank you John for some jumping off points regarding css!
